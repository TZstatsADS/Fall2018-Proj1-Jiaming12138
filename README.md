### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by [Jiaming Yan]

+ Project summary: In this project I searched such moments that people are happy for others. I feel like happy moments should not only contain simple things like eating a sandwich. Since the goal is going deeper and searching the ture reasons that make people happy, I cut data by groups defined by me and used text mining tools to find the answer.
